This app uses the technology of python programming language and deployed using Heroko platform. IDE used is Pycharm which is my favorite ever. As for as the libraries concerned, I used Flask, SQLAlchemy, SQLite3,etc., Front end designed using HTML5, CSS and JS. Since SQLite used as a DB, database may get refreshed everyday by Heroko. Apart from this, this is simple example of CRUD anatomy.
